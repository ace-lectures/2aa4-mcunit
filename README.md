# Building the McUnit Framework

- Author: SÃ©bastien Mosser
- Version: 2024.03

## Rationale

this repository contains a step-by-step implemention of an xUnit-like framework to implement and execute unit tests in Java. It is designed incrementally, and is planned to run in ~200 minutes (four lecture slots of 50 minutes each).

- Lecture #1: **First things firsts**
    - Step #0: [Technical Environment](./docs/0_tech.md)
    - Step #1: [Creating assertions](./docs/1_assertions.md)
- Lecture #2: **Adding some flesh to the walking skeleton**
    - Step #2: [Test Cases](./docs/2_test_case.md)
    - Step #3: [Test Result Collection](./docs/3_test_results.md)
- Lecture #3: **Integration with Java**
    - Step #4: [Organizing tests into test suites](./docs/4_test_suites.md)
    - Step #5: [Tests as good old methods](./docs/5_methods.md)
- Lecture #4: **Dark Arts: Code Introspection**
    - Step #6: [Test Scanner](./docs/6_test_scanner.md)
    - Step #7: [Using Annotations instead of Inheritance](./docs/7_annotations.md)

## How to navigate the repository?

Each step is releases with a tag. You can `git checkout step_x` to a given tag, and then see how the code is looking at the end of `step_x`.
